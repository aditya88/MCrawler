MCrawler version 0.01
=====================

The README is used to introduce the module and provide instructions on
how to install the module, any machine dependencies it may have (for
example C compilers and installed libraries) and any other information
that should be provided before the module is installed.

A README file is required for CPAN modules since CPAN extracts the
README file from a module distribution so that people browsing the
archive can use it get an idea of the modules uses. It is usually a
good idea to provide version information here so that people can
decide whether fixes for the module are worth downloading.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL				 --> creates make file
   make                          --> automatically checks dependencies and install required packages from CPAN
   make test					 --> tests not working need to write some
   make install					 --> avoid installing it since in development phase
   
   Creating Database
   
   createdb -W -O crawler -U crawler crawlerdb   			   --> crawler is user
   												 			   --> crawlerdb is DB name
   												 			   --> default password is 'crawler'
   
   All default database values can be changed in MCrawler_config.yml
   
   psql -f <root_dir>/MCrawler_DB.sql -U crawler -d crawlerdb  --> creates database
   
   create roles for database clients:
   login psql with super user permissions
   CREATE ROLE "client_"<client_id> WITH LOGIN PASSWORD <client_database_password> ;
   example: CREATE ROLE client_8989 WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'secret';
   
   Starting the Crawler and Server 
   
   cd <Root_directory>
   perl Crawler.PL
   
   Starting Client
   
   perl MClient.PL
   
   Client command format:
   Making new request   		 --> new_request
   Checking messages from server --> check_inbox
   Queueing a URL				 --> queue_url <request_id> <url>
   Queueing a file with URLs	 --> queue_file <request_id> <file_location>              
   Other Settings				 --> downloads_type <request_id> <user_value>			  not_used
   								 --> depth_of_search <request_id> <user_value>			  default_value -> 3
   								 --> refresh_rate <request_id> <user_value>				  default_value -> 60*60*24
   								 --> allowed_content <request_id> <user_value>			  default_value -> html|txt
   								 --> user_agent <request_id> <user_value>				  default_value -> MCrawler bot (http://cyber.law.harvard.edu)
								 --> dequeue_request <request_id>
								 --> check_status <request_id>
   
   format of seeds.txt file is new line seperated URLs 
DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

	These are compulsory modules inorder to run Makefile.PL
	
	-> ExtUtils::MakeMaker
	-> ExtUtils::AutoInstall
	
SAMPLE INPUT/OUTPUT
Admin creates a role by logging into crawler database with psql
CREATE ROLE client_8989 WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'client_password';
change server port(default is 6666) and client id in MClient.PL pass it to client
client starts a request by entering new_request.here is a series of standard commands.

--> initiating a new request
input --> new_request
input --> check_inbox
output --> you(8989) made new request 23

--> sending input to server
input --> queue_url 23 http://wikipedia.org
input --> queue_file 23 ./seeds.txt

--> configuring the request
input --> depth_of_search 23 10
input --> refresh_rate 23 7200
input --> user_agent 23 MCrawler-bot/1.0 (http://cyber.law.harvard.edu)

--> committing the request 
input --> commit_request 23

-->status checking
input --> check_status 23
output --> please check your request status on view_8989_23 table.
			Out of 1 URLs,0 URLs are completed and remaining are in processing.

next client login to postgres server with given password by admin.
and can only has SELECT permission on view_8989_23 view.

-->dequeueing
input --> dequeue_request 23 
dequeue removes request_id from the queue and stops any requests with that request_id.
And any data in database with that request_id will be removed.


if client has module to contact server directly syntax of communication can be seen after executing every command.
